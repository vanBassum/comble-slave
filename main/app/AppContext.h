// The application layer's context: owns this product's managers and answers AppProvider.
//
// This is the file a fork edits. Strux's own managers, their init order and their wiring
// all live one layer down in StruxContext, so pulling an improvement from the template
// does not touch anything here — which is the whole reason the layers were split.
//
// Adding an application manager means: create the class taking AppProvider&, add an
// accessor to AppProvider, add the member here, and call its Init() below. The framework
// does not need to be told it exists; the manager registers its own commands and
// settings into Strux from its Init().
