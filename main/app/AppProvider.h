// What one application manager may reach for: its peers, the framework beneath it, and
// the board beneath that. Implemented by AppContext and handed to every app
// manager at construction — the same shape as StruxProvider one layer down, so a manager
// still takes exactly one reference and finds everything through it.
//
// The two extra accessors are what make this the top layer: getStrux() reaches down to
// the framework (register a command, read a setting, take a telemetry point) and
// getBoard() reaches past it to the hardware. Neither points back up, and nothing in
// Strux or on the BoardContext can see this interface at all.
