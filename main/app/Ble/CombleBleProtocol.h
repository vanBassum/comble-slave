// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The BLE contract between a Comble host (WT-SC01 Plus) and a Comble slave
// (wireless UART adapter).
//
// THIS FILE MUST STAY IDENTICAL IN MEANING ON BOTH SIDES. The host keeps its
// own copy at `Comble master/main/app/Ble/CombleBleProtocol.h`; same UUIDs,
// same advertising layout. Change one side alone and the link stops pairing
// with no error that says why — the KC1245 gateway/thermostat pair carries the
// same warning for the same reason.
//
// Roles: the SLAVE is the peripheral. It advertises and hosts the GATT table;
// the host scans, picks one, pairs and subscribes. That split is deliberate —
// several slaves must be discoverable at once by whichever host is looking, and
// a peripheral is the role that scales to "a bag of adapters on a bench".
//
// Not in here yet: the UART transport itself (line config, flow control,
// sequencing). This is the discovery-and-ownership layer only, and the
// characteristics below are the seam that transport will later use.
